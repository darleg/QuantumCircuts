# Quantum Circuts

To understand quantum circuits, you'll need a grasp
of several key concepts from linear algebra and 
quantum mechanics.  Here are the essentials:


A. Mathmatics

  1. Geometry
  2. Trigonometry
  3. Vectors
  4. Linear Algerbra
  5. Complex Numbers
  6. Probability Theory

B. Quantum Mechanics

 1. Qubits
 2. Entanglement
 3. Superposition
 4. Quantum Gates
 5. Measurement
 6. Quantum Algorithms


 So, i would not want to have to learn all of this at once.
 If you are lucky, you would have pick up most of it in little
 byte size bits. This is in my case. Advance mathmatics in high
