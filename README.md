# Quantum Circuits

To understand quantum circuits, you'll need a grasp
of several key concepts from linear algebra and 
quantum mechanics.  Here are the essentials:


A. Mathematics

  1. Geometry
  2. Trigonometry
  3. Vectors
  4. Linear Algebra
  5. Complex Numbers
  6. Probability Theory

B. Quantum Mechanics

 1. Qubits
 2. Entanglement
 3. Superposition
 4. Quantum Gates
 5. Measurement
 6. Quantum Algorithms


So, I would not want to have to learn all of this at once.
If you are lucky, you would have pick up most of it in little
byte size bits. This is in my case. Self-learning electronics
starting in 7th grade. Advance mathematics in high school and
higher mathematics and Computer Science in university classes.
Technical schools in Physics and Electronics as an Inertial,
Doppler Radar, and Navigational Computer Specialist for 5 years
also, as a Nuclear Instrumentation Specialist for 3 years.
One more thing; Periodic testing of underwater ordinance and
designing and building interfaces for Automatic Test Equipment
as an Engineering Technologist for 4 years. Before I retired,
worked as a Computer Specialist for 12 years. Specialized in 
three different areas, Data Communications, Software Analyst,
and Systems Analyst.

There is nothing to worry about here. I am no genius so this
is going to be simple. There will be some mathematics equations.
Some things are just easier with equations, like simulation and
Physics. I probably will not even get into Quantum Physics much.
I just want to show that a Quantum Computer is a computer. So,
There should be a way to program it.
