# Quantum Circuits

To understand quantum circuits, you'll need a grasp
of several key concepts from linear algebra and 
quantum mechanics.  Here are the essentials:


A. Mathematics

  1. Geometry
  2. Trigonometry
  3. Vectors
  4. Linear Algebra
  5. Complex Numbers
  6. Probability Theory

B. Quantum Mechanics

 1. Qubits
 2. Entanglement
 3. Superposition
 4. Quantum Gates
 5. Measurement
 6. Quantum Algorithms


So, I would not want to have to learn all of this at once.
If you are lucky, you would have pick up most of it in little
byte size bits. This is in my case. Advance mathematics in
high school and higher mathematics in university classes.
